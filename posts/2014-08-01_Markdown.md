#The Markdown Example Post


#Links
This is an [example link](http://http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics). It points to the real Markdown documentation.

This is an [example link (hover me)](http://example.com/ "With a hover Title"). It just goes to Google :)

If you just want to display the link inline, use <http://example.com/>

This also works with email addresses <a@b.com>


#Reference Links
You can have a link to a [source][1] and it will set it up for you.

The link descriptor is also [optional][], but can get confusing.

In fact, this will work over your whole document, and can even use text for the link descriptor [document][link3].

[1]: http://google.com/			"Google 1"
[optional]: http://google.com/	"Google 2"
[link3]: http://google.com/		"Google 3"


#Images
You can put images into a page like this:

![Mega Man](/assets/2014-08-01/megaman.jpg "Mega Man")

#Reference Images
But you can also put images in using syntax like reference links above:

![Mega Man][img1]

[img1]: /assets/2014-08-01/megaman.jpg "Mega Man"
